# 👋 Hey there, I’m Edwin!  

- 🚀 A software engineering student who dreams in logic, designs in pixels, and thinks in revolutions.
- 🧠 I’m all about coding ideas that outlast their hype—whether it’s Godot scripts, backend logic, or game mechanics.
- 🛠 Currently building games and experimenting with systems that break the usual mold.
- 🕹 Open to collabs in game dev, AI, or anything that sounds slightly insane but wildly cool.
- 🔥 I believe code can start revolutions. Let’s build something people remember.
